# STAT394-garbo

Started the EDA, I've got most of the graphs on there and the skeleton code which I plan on improving and adding to during the week. 
Haven't started writing about the graphs or anything else. 
Currently has histograms, box plots and Q-Q plots for all the numeric variables, covariance and correlation matrices and a correlogram. 
Feel free to add anything or lmk if I need to add anything.

21/9/23 - Thomas - fixed the preliminary EDA section to have consistent colouring between plots, added a citation for blood pressure thresholds, added properly referenced figures and tables, as per response to feedback from Alejandro. This should help set a precedent for theming in the future.
